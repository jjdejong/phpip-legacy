Synchronize your release with the repository. In a console, go to the folder containing your files, and type:
git pull

This will upgrade the UI.

To upgrade the database, go into the "install" folder and check whether there are any upgrade scripts having a timestamp above your release.

NEVER apply a phpip_skel-xxx.sql script on a production database - it will wipe your database to recreate a new one.

To upgrade your database structure, apply, in order, ALL the phpip_upgrade-<timestamp>.sql scripts having a timestamp above your current version.

To apply an upgrade, type this in the console within the "install" folder:

mysql -u root -p phpip < phpip_upgrade-<timestamp>.sql

You will be prompted for your mysql root password.
