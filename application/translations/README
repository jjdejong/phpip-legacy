The internationalisation uses these tools:
The translation is initiated in Bootstrap.php and uses Zend_Translate and is exported via Zend_Registry.
When user is not yet known, the user's language identified by browser is used. The user selects his language in login screen.
The translator is taken from registry and exported for views in controller's init function.
In HTML and php pages, a function <?=this->translate->_()?> is used to translate strings. For javascript, this function should be encapsuled into quotes.

Strings are collected in a pot catalog using translation/po-update.sh script. The translated catalogs are also updated in the same time.
Compiled catalogs have to be generated with the command msgfmt or a tool like poedit. They are stored in application/translations directory

TODO
- translation of country names
- translation of database strings like event names and tasks, roles...
